# 🐍 Python Built-in Functions

Welcome to my repository on Python's built-in functions! This project contains Jupyter notebooks that provide simple yet effective examples of using essential built-in functions: `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, `zip`, and `enumerate`. Each notebook is designed to enhance my understanding and skills in data science by demonstrating practical applications of these functions.

## 📚 Notebooks Overview

### 1. `📄 Map.ipynb`
This notebook covers the `map` function, which applies a specified function to each item of an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) and returns an iterator. Examples include:
- 🔢 Squaring numbers in a list.
- 🌡️ Converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- ➕ Summing elements from multiple lists using lambda expressions.

### 2. `📄 Reduce.ipynb`
Explore the `reduce` function from the `functools` module, which applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list. This is useful for cumulative operations like summing all elements in a list.

### 3. `📄 Filter.ipynb`
Learn about the `filter` function, which constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. Examples include filtering even numbers from a list and selecting strings that contain a specific substring.

### 4. `📄 Zip.ipynb`
The `zip` function is covered here, showing how to combine multiple iterables (lists, tuples) element-wise into a single iterator of tuples. This is useful for parallel iteration over multiple sequences.

### 5. `📄 Enumerate.ipynb`
This notebook demonstrates the `enumerate` function, which adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object. This is particularly useful for obtaining an indexed list.

## 🛠️ How to Use

Each notebook contains a series of markdown explanations and code examples. To run the notebooks:
1. 📥 Clone this repository.
2. 🛠️ Ensure you have Jupyter installed (`pip install jupyter`).
3. 🖥️ Open the terminal and navigate to the cloned repository.
4. 🚀 Launch Jupyter Notebook by running `jupyter notebook`.
5. 📂 Select and run the desired notebook.

## 🎯 Conclusion

These notebooks are intended to provide a solid foundation in using Python's built-in functions, crucial for data science and general programming tasks.

Have Fun! 🎉
